# Image Recognition

In this repo a microservise was created to deploy an Azure Web App.
First, I found a good template with CSS and HTML files edit.
Second, I looked for a Pytorch model that recognizes images, for that I used a pre-model built in `torchvision` called ResNet.
The ResNet model is based on the Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition paper.
